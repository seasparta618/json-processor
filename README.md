# Project Overview

### Description
This project is a Go application that retrieves structured JSON input, validates it, logs it to STDOUT, and sends a request to an HTTP-based API with the input as part of the request message.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to work with JSON data, perform validation, interact with HTTP APIs, and handle errors effectively in Go.

## Challenges and Considerations

### JSON Validation: 
- Implementing comprehensive validation rules to ensure that only valid JSON input is processed.
- The validation process should be elegant and efficient, even for large JSON structures, with as few error returns as possible. 
- It is not hard to parse and unmarshal the json, but it might be challengable to build the json parsing progress friendly & transparently to the user and return reasonable and meaningful errors at the same time. It is not a good practice each time just return 1 error then return another one at next time, ideally, the parsing progress should be able to return all the errors at once.

### HTTP API Interaction: 
Handling the communication with an external HTTP API, including constructing the request, processing the response, and managing errors. The challenge is to ensure robust and reliable API interaction, especially in the face of network issues or API downtime.

### Logging: 
Deciding what information to log and how to format it for readability and usefulness. The challenge is to log enough information to be useful for debugging and monitoring, without overwhelming the log files with unnecessary details.

### Error Handling: 
Developing a strategy for handling and reporting errors throughout the application. The challenge is to handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages, and avoiding application crashes.

### Testing: 
Writing tests to cover various scenarios and ensure the reliability of the application. The challenge is to create comprehensive and effective tests, especially for the parts of the application that interact with external APIs. 

### Code Maintainability: 
Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. The challenge is to structure the code in a way that is easy to understand and modify in the future.
